Simple Neural Network for digits recognition with Pytorch.

main.py: file main that Download the MNIST dataset (in a folder named input, automatically created in the project folder).
          After the download a Neural Network is trained and a simple test on an image is executed.
          
networks.py: file that contains some Neural network definition. These Neural Networks can be utilized in the main.py file.
